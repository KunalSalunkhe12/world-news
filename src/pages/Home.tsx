      "Best Bitcoin Casinos in the UK (Updated List): UK Crypto Casino Sites",
    text: "Throw in hundreds (or thousands!) of exclusive BTC games, and it becomes clear why many players prefer to gamble using cryptos. We’ve tried and tested multiple UK Bitcoin casinos and come up with this list of the top 14. Each one has been verified according to criteria such as the quality of their games and bonuses, and they’re all safe and secure to use. And while we view Red Dog is the best UK online Bitcoin casino right now, you’re welcome to check out our other top picks as each one offers something unique. Let’s see what we’ve got for you… Best Bitcoin Casino Sites in the UK Red Dog Casino: Best Bitcoin casino for UK players overall Bitcoin.com Games: Top pick for Bitcoin slots KingBit: Best Bitcoin bonuses PlayOJO: Great no wagering bonus (BTC via other methods) BC.Game: 40+ cryptos accepted 1. Red Dog Casino - Best Bitcoin Casino in the UK Overall Minimum deposit is $20 for BTC and ETH. The code REDCOIN is valid once during the first five deposits and has a maximum cash out of 20 times the deposit. The maximum allowed bet is $10. Note that the full T&C’s apply. Pros: 320% deposit bonus for new players Brand-new crypto casino Stylish site design Great game variety Direct Bitcoin deposits & withdrawals Also accepts Ethereum Cons: Guests can’t see the live games Red Dog Casino is one of the newest and most stylish Bitcoin casinos in the UK. Registering for an account couldn’t be easier, there’s a 320% first deposit bonus on the table for new players, and the mobile version is a delight. Let’s see why it’s our top-rated casino. Bitcoin Compatibility: 4.9/5 Red Dog Casino accepts four cryptocurrencies – Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and Tether. It’s a bit of a shame that Bitcoin Cash is absent, but the good news is that all withdrawals are processed within a 15-minute timeframe. What’s more, while the $150 minimum withdrawals will be a bit steep for some UK players, the fact that there are zero maximum withdrawals will certainly suit others. Casino Games: 4.8/5 Red Dog Casino doesn’t have a huge menu of games (just under 200, on our last count). But this doesn’t have to be seen as a negative if you think about Red Dog’s true appeal. For one thing, this Bitcoin casino gets all of its games from one iGaming provider – RealTime Gaming, which is known for its innovative, action-packed, high RTP, big jackpot games. We like the “quality over quantity” approach here – especially as all the categories we’re looking for are covered, including online slots, blackjack, roulette, video poker, speciality games, and live casino section. Red Dog is also a heavily bonus-driven casino, which is to say they hand out bonus spins and deposit bonuses regularly. There are also 13 live dealer games here, but note that you won’t be able to see them until you sign-up. Bonuses and Promotions: 5/5 When you first join Red Dog Casino, you’re entitled to a 320% slots bonus. Minimum deposit for Bitcoin and Ethereum is $20 and wagering requirements are set at 35x. To claim this bonus, you need to use the bonus code REDCOIN. Red Dog Casino then rewards you every single day with a matched deposit bonus each time you make a deposit of either $30, $75 or $150. Not just that, but Bitcoin players from the UK get treated to an extra 25%. There are also bonus spins to be won on the Bonus Wheel, as well as a New Game bonus, which treats you to more spins when you play X number of spins on the selected new game (whatever that may be at the time). Reputation: 5/5 Red Dog is owned by Infinity Media, which owns and operates a number of other existing and reliable online casinos. It’s also consistently ranked as one of the best mobile casinos in the UK. It’s also licensed, SSL-encrypted and uses two-factor authentication. All of which means that, despite its newness, this is a safe and secure casino site. We had no trouble playing games here, and the withdrawals we requested were instant. Misc: 4.9/5 Another thing about this Bitcoin casino is that there’s an entire page called “RTP” that’s dedicated to listing the exact RTP for all their slot games. This helps you to find the games that represent your biggest chances of winning. Ready to get started at the best online Bitcoin casino with a 320% deposit bonus? Click here to join Red Dog Casino today. 2. Bitcoin.com Games - Superior Quality Slots of all the Best Bitcoin Casinos in the UK The welcome offer is only available for all players with a valid email address registered on the website. The promotion is limited to one welcome cashback offer per one person, one email, and one deposit address. Note that full T&Cs apply. Pros: Great range of exclusive slot games Daily jackpots Rewarding VIP club 25% cashback for new UK players Slots tournaments Direct Bitcoin & Bitcoin Cash banking Cons: It could accept more altcoins Bitcoin.com Games is the online casino branch of Bitcoin (yep, the digital coin now has its very own casino). Once you’re all signed up, you’ll be treated to some of the best online slots UK players can find online, daily tournaments, and a lucrative VIP club that rewards regular players. Bitcoin Compatibility: 4.5/5 Bitcoin.com gives you two options. You can either play games with Bitcoin Cash or Bitcoin. Whichever option you select refreshes the screen but – as far as we can see – the games are the exact same. A neat feature is that the site lists the exact value of each coin at the top of the screen. Other than that, withdrawals are typically processed within 10 minutes, although there is a very small 0.0001 BTC service charge each time you make a withdrawal. Online Bitcoin Gambling Games: 4.8/5 Like all the best Bitcoin casinos, most of the games at Bitcoin.com are slot games. However, because this Bitcoin casino site gets its games from less popular iGaming developers, you won’t find household names like Starburst and Book of Dead. That doesn’t mean you still can’t get a chance to win big here – you can. Indeed, there are lots of high RTP slots, and it’s interesting that the site gives each game a star rating out of five. Other than lots of original and exciting slot games, you can play a handful of classic table games like Jacks or Better, French Roulette, and Blackjack Surrender. There are live casino games here too, as well as a series of exclusive titles, and speciality games like keno. Bonuses and Promotions: 4.5/5 Bitcoin.com’s welcome bonus is a bit different from most other welcome offers. Instead of matching your first deposit, it gives you the chance to claim 25% cash back on your losses during your first two weeks. This is actually a VIP offer, which means you must opt-in to become a VIP when you create your account, and the bonus is only eligible on slot games. Alternatively, you could go for the 20% cashback welcome bonus instead if you decide to make a smaller first deposit. This is open to non-VIPs and you only need to deposit $50 to claim it. Reputation: 5/5 Bitcoin was prompted to come up with its very own online casino because, well, crypto gambling is so popular. And kudos to them because they’ve created an amazing crypto casino. It’s a fairly new addition to the Bitcoin betting market but we can vouch for its owners, SBGC. It’s also fully licensed, it’s got provably fair games, and has a 100% payout rate. No complaints here. Misc: 4.8/5 In our experience, Bitcoin.com is one of the easiest Bitcoin casinos to sign-up to. You can join and play anonymously and everything is hassle-free. A drawback is the lack of live chat, as well as the fact that it doesn’t accept any other digital coins besides BTC and BCH. On the flip side, that won’t matter to Bitcoin bettors. Ready to get started with some slots action? Click here to join Bitcoin.com today. 3. KingBit - Best Bitcoin Bonuses of any UK Bitcoin Casino Site Any bonus is limited to one per player, user, IP address, computer, device, household, phone number, home address, payment method, email address. A minimum deposit of at least 0.20 mBTC (200 µBTC) is required for players to be eligible for the welcome bonus. Note that full T&Cs apply. Pros: Welcome package up to 2 BTC Over 1,200 games One of the best UK roulette sites for Bitcoin users 2 BTC monthly reload bonus SSL-secure Live chat customer support Cons: Design not for everyone KingBit is the King of Bitcoin casino bonuses, with players able to snap up two reload promos each month. You can also play more than 1,200 games including jackpot slots, blackjack, and American Roulette. Bitcoin Compatibility: 4.7/5 KingBit accepts a range of cryptos, but its main focus is Bitcoin. There are no fees involved, and banking with KingBit is 100% safe. According to KingBit themselves, Bitcoin withdrawals can take as long as 24 hours to process. This is longer than average for Bitcoin withdrawals. That said, most withdrawals should be processed within an hour. The reason they could take longer is if a game play check needs to be carried out. This sometimes happens. The minimum withdrawal, meanwhile, is 2 mBTC. Casino Games: 4.8/5 With a casino library packed with over 1,200 games, there should be something here for everyone. There are five main game categories at KingBit: Slots, live casino, roulette, blackjack and baccarat. Poker games are a little harder to find, but you can use the search function to find the likes of Joker Poker, Three Card Poker, and Bonus Poker. KingBit especially fares well when it comes to live dealer games. Most of these are provided by BetGames and Evolution and include 10+ live poker games, as well as over 50 blackjack, roulette, and baccarat variants. Bonuses and Promotions: 5/5 UK players can snap up a 2 BTC welcome bonus. This is split into a pair of deposit bonuses - the first is a 110% up to 1 BTC deposit bonus and the second is a 55% up to 1 BTC deposit bonus. These are quickly followed by two monthly reload bonuses that top up your deposits every single month. Reputation: 4.8/5 KingBit was launched in 2019, which makes it one of the more recent additions to the Bitcoin gambling world – hence not the perfect score. Its games are provided by some of the biggest names in iGaming, such as Evolution, BetSoft, and Pragmatic Play, and the site is secured by 128-bit SSL encryption. There’s also a strict privacy policy that you can find on the website. Misc: 4/5 Customer support is available via live chat and email (although telephone support doesn’t seem to be available). The user interface, meanwhile, is fun and funky and brought to life with vivid animations and graphics. KingBit is a top Bitcoin casino for bonuses. Get started and claim your monthly reload offers by clicking here. 4. PlayOJO - Best No Wagering Bonus of All Top UK Bitcoin Casinos First deposit only. Minimum deposit of £10. 50 Bonus Spins on the Book of Dead slot. Bonus Spin valued at £0.10. OJO’s Rewards and Game Policy applies. Full T&Cs apply. Pros: No wagering bonuses 50 bonus spins for new players Over 3,200 games Great UK online blackjack site (50+ variants) Friendly site design Cons: Need to use other payment methods as a Bitcoin workaround A Bitcoin casino that offers no wagering bonuses? It’s a rarity – but that’s exactly what PlayOjo is all about. All their promos come with zero wagering requirements (and zero maximum wins). PlayOjo is also home to more than 3,200 games – and you can even play bingo here. Bitcoin Compatibility: 3.5/5 Okay, now for the tricky bit: PlayOjo accepts Bitcoin players, but it doesn’t accept Bitcoin directly. What does this mean? It means if you join, you’ll need to use another banking option as a workaround. Essentially, you’ll need to create an account for one of the payment methods they offer if you don’t already have one, deposit your coins, and then transfer them to your PlayOjo account. It’s actually much easier than it might sound and you won’t lose a dime due to any awkward exchange rates. Casino Games: 5/5 As mentioned, PlayOjo boasts a collection of 3,200+ games. This pretty much means there should be something for everyone. At PlayOjo, you can play more than 50 blackjack games, take your pick from well over a thousand slots, and check out 130+ live games. There are also plenty of bingo rooms here, including (at the time of writing) Jubilee Bingo, as well as a range of speciality games. These include scratch cards and board games. We also like the fact that PlayOjo lets you know how popular each game is. All you have to do is hover over the thumbnail of any game and it will reveal how many times it was played in the last six hours. It will also show you each game's biggest ever win. Bonuses and Promotions: 4.8/5 One of PlayOjo’s biggest draws is arguably the no wagering bonuses. We weren’t fibbing earlier when we said the bonuses come with no wagering requirements attached. New players can grab 50 no wagering bonus spins just for signing up and making a first deposit. Alternatively, you can claim 50 bingo tickets if you prefer, plus 10 bonus spins on top. On the flip side, PlayOjo lacks regular deposit bonuses. You can spin the bonus wheel for more spins, as well as check out “Ojo’s Specials”. Reputation: 5/5 PlayOjo was launched in 2017 and is now easily one of the best UK online casinos. Owned by Skill on Net, it’s fully licensed by the UK Gambling Commission, it’s been seen on the telly (many times) and it’s even got Noel Edmonds (Deal or No Deal bingo, anyone?). In short, it’s one of the most reliable and trustworthy online casinos around. Misc: 4/5 One last thing worth mentioning is PlayOjo’s bright and breezy site design. It won’t be to everyone’s taste, but if you’re looking to put your feet up and have some fun on games like bingo and roulette, PlayOjo has a warm and inviting “Friday night in” kinda vibe. Ready to try those no wagering bonuses? Click here to get started at PlayOjo today. 5. BC Game - Best UK Bitcoin Casino for Game Variety Achieve tasks and get rewards. Lucky spin bonus allows you to spin and get up to 1 BTC. Note that full T&Cs apply. Pros: 40+ accepted cryptos Vibrant user interface Many exclusive BTC games like Ultimate Dice 24/7 customer support 2,000+ games Raft of unique features Great options for Bitcoin betting Cons: Web design won’t be to everyone’s tastes The first thing you’ll notice when you arrive at BC Game is how colourful this Bitcoin casino is. With its eye-popping icons, snazzy animations, and unique user layout, it’s easily the most stylish casino site in our review guide. Bitcoin Compatibility: 5/5 Bitcoin deposits and withdrawals are near-instant at BC Game casino. There’s a very minor 0.1% withdrawal fee each time you process a withdrawal here. In addition to Bitcoin, BC Game also accepts DOGE, LTC, XLM, TRX, BCH, XMR, BSC, ABC, NBX and VSYS - as well as more than 35 other coins. Online Casino Games: 5/5 BC Games goes the extra mile when it comes to their games in the UK. There are well over a few thousand here, and these include a number of “BC Originals,” lottery games, dice games, as well as all the classic table games. You can also play game shows, house games like Crash and Mines, and - of course - slot games. As well as being stylish, BC Game has added a number of innovations that make it super-playable. For instance, there’s a “Recent Play” tab that makes it easy for you to watch the games you’ve just played, as well as a forum where you can connect with other players. There's also a “Recently Added” category for the latest games in the BC Game library. Bonuses and Promotions: 4/5 There’s a 150% first deposit bonus on the table for new players. It’s a good offer but the only drawback is that the minimum deposit is $60. Meanwhile, existing players can participate in the regular lottery draws for the chance to win a cool $100,000. You can also have a go at the Mega Spin for the chance to win either bonus spins or cash prizes. There’s also a VIP club that randomly rewards players in the chat room each day, as well as this it lets you unlock numerous perks, including the ability to have private chats with other BC Games users. Reputation: 5/5 BC Game was launched in 2017. It’s since become a trusted Bitcoin casino among iGaming enthusiasts that has a clear privacy policy on its website, a license to operate in the UK, and reliable owners. The games are provided by the likes of BetSoft, NetEnt, and EvoPlay, and the casino is known for paying out huge sums of money on a regular basis to winners. Misc: 4.5/5 The forum is well worth a visit. It’s buzzing with active members who enjoy sharing betting stories with other users, and it’s a great place to meet new people and make new friends. Like the sound of playing at a stylish, innovative, and wholly unique Bitcoin casino? Click here to get started at BC Game today.

BitStarz – Best Online Bitcoin Slots Site Overall Pros Mouthwatering welcome bonus up to 5 BTC 4,000+ bitcoin slots 24/7 live chat support Great cashback and Slots Wars promos Payouts within 10 minutes Cons Limited video poker selection Telephone support not available If you are looking for a BTC slot site with the best welcome bonus, BitStarz is definitely one to consider. Here, you can enjoy a great selection of bitcoin slots, and there are plenty of deposit and withdrawal options for you – this is quite simply one of the top rated Bitcoin casinos around. Game Selection 4.6/5 BitStarz is home to over 2,000 BTC slots from top developers. Whether you love Megaways slots or bonus buy features, there is a wide variety of types available at the online casino. The operator also does extremely well in other game departments. You can access the “Bitcoin Games” category to see the games you can play using this cryptocurrency, which also has several live casino games and table games. However, its specialty game selection is not that impressive, as it only has one keno and two bingo games are available. Bonuses and Promotions 4.8/5 This is where BitStarz performs better than others. Whether you are a new or existing player, there is something for everyone at Bitstarz. The welcome bonus is fantastic as you can claim up to 5 BTC and 180 free spins over your first four deposits at the betting site. The welcome bonus comes with a 40x wagering requirement, which is moderate compared to other betting sites. In addition, the operator hosts weekly BTC slot tournaments, where you can compete for $5000 and 5,000 free spins just for your regular gameplay. Mobile Compatibility 4.3/5 The mobile experience at BitStarz may not be the best as there is no downloadable mobile app, but this doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy playing your favorite BTC slots on the go. The betting site is both mobile-friendly and easy to navigate. Besides, several unique features on the platform improve your overall betting experience.

Related: Best Bitcoin Dice Sites Why Is Bitstarz the Best Site to Play Slots With Bitcoin? As we mentioned before, there are hundreds of sites to play slots with Bitcoin. This makes it hard to determine the top crypto slots site. That said, for us we’re slotting Bitstarz into the number one spot in our list of best casino sites for the following reasons: Unbeatable crypto slot casino: Sites like Ignition can bring the heat quality-wise, but how many crypto casinos can roll out a menu with virtually unending selection? We’re fans of variety and the thousands of crypto slot games at Bitstarz really won us over. Great Bitcoin welcome bonus: A lot of slots sites that accept crypto pay their bonuses out in fiat. Not Bitstarz. Here you’ll get a massive first deposit bonus package up to 5 BTC – and the fun doesn’t stop there as they give away tons of crypto in their weekly slot tournaments too. Lighting-quick payouts: It’s no fun playing crypto slots if you can’t cash out your winnings. That’s why we back Bitstarz and their record payout time of 8 minutes – don’t believe it? They’ve got a cashout ticker right on their homepage. Award winning quality: The trophy case at Bitstarz reads like some casino CEO’s annual goal list. Best Crypto Casino, Best Operator, Best Support, Player’s Choice Award and more. This means you’re getting one of the most reliable Bitcoin slots casinos around. Types of Bitcoin Slot Games You Can Play Online You can play different kinds of bitcoin slots from top-tier developers at the best-rated betting sites. These slots come with in-game bonus features such as free spins, multipliers, wilds and scatters. Here are some common types of bitcoin slots available: Classic Slots These are bitcoin slots that come with three rows and reels. They are considered the foundation of slot machines and are now modernized and available at top betting sites. Branded Slots When you see a slot themed after a well-known brand, game, or movie, it is a branded slot. The beauty of these Bitcoin slot games is that they often resonate well with the players and have more engaging, thrilling stories to them. Megaways Slots These slots do not use the regular paylines where you must land the same symbols on a payline to win. Instead, they offer adjacent-reels wins or use a Cluster Pays mechanism for a cluster horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win. Progressive Jackpot Slots BTC progressive jackpot slots offer much larger wins than their counterparts. Each time a player bets without winning the jackpot prize, part of their bet is added to the prize. This continues until someone wins and the jackpot resets. Related: Best Online Craps Best Bitcoin Slot Bonuses Available Welcome bonuses: This is a bonus offered to new players when registering an account with a bitcoin slot site. The bonus can take different forms and can be offered as a no deposit or deposit bonus. Free spins: Top online casinos offer free spins which let you play rounds on crypto slot games for free without risking your hard-earned money. Match bonuses: This type of bonus is awarded as a percentage of the deposit a player made. It is one of the most common forms of welcome bonuses. Cashback offers: Operators offer this kind of bonus as a percentage of the amount players lost within a specified duration. VIP rewards: Some betting sites treat their loyal players special by offering them VIP rewards. They often have a VIP program where their members can enjoy perks such as exclusive bonuses, faster withdrawals, and dedicated account managers. Guide to Playing Bitcoin Slots at Top Crypto Slots Sites Can I Play Bitcoin Slots for Free? Yes. You can play bitcoin slots for free at top online betting sites or, in some cases, on the provider’s platform that designs the game. Many bettors play free bitcoin slots to test the features of the games and familiarize themselves with the gameplay. However, note that you cannot win real money when playing for free. There are also free spins offers to keep an eye out, where typically online Bitcoin casinos give you 10, 50, or 100 spins on a slot – with winnings being yours to keep, typically with a rollover. How Much Can I Win Playing Bitcoin Slots? This differs from one bitcoin slot to another. Every online casino game, including BTC slots, has a defined paytable that determines how much a player can win. For instance, progressive jackpots offer huge payouts in the hundreds of thousands or perhaps even millions. You can check the paytable of a bitcoin slot to know what it has to offer, even before wagering real money. How Fast Do Top Bitcoin Online Casinos Process Payouts? The best BTC casino sites process payouts quickly. However, please bear in mind the processing time may differ from one operator to the other. If you place a withdrawal request, you can expect to receive the winnings within a few hours or days. That said, note that using bonuses to play bitcoin slots may come with wagering requirements. You will need to fulfill the wagering requirement before withdrawing any winnings. Do I Need to Download an App to Play Mobile Bitcoin Slot Games? Not necessarily. Most top-rated BTC slots sites are instant play casinos. They are designed using HTML 5 and other related technologies. This means you can access their platforms and play bitcoin slots without downloading and installing any app. All you need to do is enter the betting site URL in your web browser to access it and play Bitcoin slot games. However, if a betting site offers a proprietary app, you can install it on your mobile device to access its platform and play games. However, note that not all bitcoin slots are available to play on mobile. The availability depends on the betting site and the game provider.

Related: Best Bitcoin Dice Sites Why Is Bitstarz the Best Site for Bitcoin Slots? As we mentioned before, there are hundreds of sites to play slots with Bitcoin. This makes it hard to determine the top crypto slots site. That said, for us we’re slotting Bitstarz into the number one spot in our list of best casino sites for the following reasons: Unbeatable crypto slot casino: Sites like Ignition can bring the heat quality-wise, but how many crypto casinos can roll out a menu with virtually unending selection? We’re fans of variety and the thousands of crypto slot games at Bitstarz really won us over. Great Bitcoin welcome bonus: A lot of slots sites that accept crypto pay their bonuses out in fiat. Not Bitstarz. Here you’ll get a massive first deposit bonus package up to 5 BTC – and the fun doesn’t stop there as they give away tons of crypto in their weekly slot tournaments too. Lighting-quick payouts: It’s no fun playing crypto slots if you can’t cash out your winnings. That’s why we back Bitstarz and their record payout time of 8 minutes – don’t believe it? They’ve got a cashout ticker right on their homepage. Award winning quality: The trophy case at Bitstarz reads like some casino CEO’s annual goal list. Best Crypto Casino, Best Operator, Best Support, Player’s Choice Award and more. This means you’re getting one of the most reliable Bitcoin slots casinos around. Guide to Playing Bitcoin Slots at Top Crypto Slots Sites What Kind of Bitcoin Slots Can I Play At the Best Online Casinos? You can play different kinds of bitcoin slots from top-tier developers at the best-rated betting sites. These slots come with in-game bonus features such as free spins, multipliers, wilds and scatters. Here are some common types of bitcoin slots available: Classic Slots: These are bitcoin slots that come with three rows and reels. They are considered the foundation of slot machines and are now modernized and available at top betting sites. Branded Slots: When you see a slot themed after a well-known brand, game, or movie, it is a branded slot. The beauty of these Bitcoin slot games is that they often resonate well with the players and have more engaging, thrilling stories to them. Megaways Slots: These slots do not use the regular paylines where you must land the same symbols on a payline to win. Instead, they offer adjacent-reels wins or use a Cluster Pays mechanism for a cluster horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win. Progressive Jackpot Slots: BTC progressive jackpot slots offer much larger wins than their counterparts. Each time a player bets without winning the jackpot prize, part of their bet is added to the prize. This continues until someone wins and the jackpot resets. Related: Best Online Craps Can I Play Bitcoin Slots for Free? Yes. You can play bitcoin slots for free at top online betting sites or, in some cases, on the provider’s platform that designs the game. Many bettors play free bitcoin slots to test the features of the games and familiarize themselves with the gameplay. However, note that you cannot win real money when playing for free. There are also free spins offers to keep an eye out, where typically online Bitcoin casinos give you 10, 50, or 100 spins on a slot – with winnings being yours to keep, typically with a rollover. How Much Can I Win Playing Bitcoin Slots? This differs from one bitcoin slot to another. Every online casino game, including BTC slots, has a defined paytable that determines how much a player can win. For instance, progressive jackpot slots offer huge payouts in the hundreds of thousands or perhaps even millions. You can check the paytable of a bitcoin slot to know what it has to offer, even before wagering real money. How Fast Do Top Bitcoin Online Casinos Process Payouts? The best BTC casino sites process payouts quickly. However, please bear in mind the processing time may differ from one operator to the other. If you place a withdrawal request, you can expect to receive the winnings within a few hours or days. That said, note that using bonuses to play bitcoin slots may come with wagering requirements. You will need to fulfill the wagering requirement before withdrawing any winnings. Can I Claim Bonuses at Bitcoin Slots Sites? Yes, you can. The best-rated bitcoin betting sites offer plenty of bonuses that players can claim and use on their Bitcoin slot machine games. Here are some of the common bitcoin slot bonuses: Welcome bonuses: This is a bonus offered to new players when registering an account with a bitcoin slot site. The bonus can take different forms and can be offered as a no deposit or deposit bonus. Free spins: Top online casinos offer free spins which let you play rounds on crypto slot games for free without risking your hard-earned money. Match bonuses: This type of bonus is awarded as a percentage of the deposit a player made. It is one of the most common forms of welcome bonuses. Cashback offers: Operators offer this kind of bonus as a percentage of the amount players lost within a specified duration. VIP rewards: Some betting sites treat their loyal players special by offering them VIP rewards. They often have a VIP program where their members can enjoy perks such as exclusive bonuses, faster withdrawals, and dedicated account managers. Do I Need to Download an App to Play Mobile Bitcoin Slot Games? Not necessarily. Most top-rated BTC slots sites are instant play casinos. They are designed using HTML 5 and other related technologies. This means you can access their platforms and play bitcoin slots without downloading and installing any app. All you need to do is enter the betting site URL in your web browser to access it and play Bitcoin slot games. However, if a betting site offers a proprietary app, you can install it on your mobile device to access its platform and play games. However, note that not all bitcoin slots are available to play on mobile. The availability depends on the betting site and the game provider.

      "Best Bitcoin Poker Sites: Top Crypto Poker Tournaments, Cash Games, and Poker Rooms that Accept Cryptocurrency Deposits",
    text: "Sponsored Content The best Bitcoin poker sites were virtually unheard of until a few years ago. Now, crypto poker sites are as common as Reddit-pushed altcoins – but how do you choose from the dozens of Bitcoin poker options to make sure you’re not in for a rude rug pull? It starts with fair bonuses, consistent cash game traffic, large GTD crypto poker tournaments, a flawless reputation, and of course: accepting crypto deposits to play poker. We’ve crowned Ignition our best Bitcoin poker site for these reasons and more. That said, there’s a lot more Bitcoin poker where that came from! Let’s take a deeper look. Best Bitcoin Poker Sites Ignition: Best Bitcoin poker site overall BitStarz: Best for video poker Americas Cardroom: Best MTT menu BetOnline: Best poker site for sit and gos Bovada: Best mobile poker app Slots.lv: Most lucrative Bitcoin welcome bonus Cafe Casino: Best video poker jackpots Red Dog Casino: Best reload bonuses Cloudbet: Best for crypto variety Sportsbetting.ag: Best poker room sportsbook 1. Ignition – Best Bitcoin Poker Site Overall Pros Some of the best MTT tournaments Generous combined casino and poker welcome bonus Anonymous tables for softer games High-intensity knockout tournaments User-friendly interface Cons No rakeback Steep rollover requirements The Ignition poker room has a user-friendly lobby with good player traffic and a wide range of poker variants. What we like though is that this traffic won’t likely have an unfair advantage, given all tables are anonymous and HUDs are banned. Games Selection: 4.7/5 You’ll find three main games on solid, functional software in the main poker lobby. You can choose from Texas Hold ’em, Omaha, and Omaha Hi/Lo. It’s unlikely that you won’t find suitable options with high player traffic. Their Zone Poker (speed poker), cash games, tournaments, and sit and gos will keep you thoroughly entertained. The monthly poker tournaments have a massive total prize pool of $2,000,000 – with the best being the Monthly Milly $1,000,000 guaranteed tournament. While the poker options are enough to keep you engaged, as mentioned in our Ignition Casino review you’ll find plenty of other casino games available here as well. Bonuses & Rewards: 4.8/5 As a new player, you can enjoy a 150% crypto match bonus up to $1500 in both the online poker room and online casino. At $3000 total, this is one of the largest bonuses going. Even better? Their 25x playthrough is one of the lowest of all Bitcoin casino bonuses online. Other poker promos include their Royal Flush bonus. Hit a royal flush and they’ll give you an extra 50x the big blind, with no rollover requirements. We also love the presence of a bad beat jackpot and their weekly $2500 freeroll. Banking Options: 4.8/5 In addition to Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and Ethereum you can also use credit and debit cards and vouchers to fund your account. Withdrawal options on this site are limited to Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, wire transfers, and checks. Naturally, wire transfers and checks can take up to 10 days so we recommend crypto here. You will receive your winnings within 24 hours when using Bitcoin, which is faster than most online poker sites that accept crypto. Mobile User Experience: 4.7/5 You can play Ignition poker via the intuitive mobile poker browser. With an Android or iOS operating system, you will be able to access Ignition without downloading any software. The crypto poker options in the mobile casino run smoothly, and we found no lag or anything that otherwise made us regret our position of playing from mobiles or tablets. Take advantage of a 100% first deposit bonus up to $1500 in the Ignition poker room. Related: Best Ignition bonus codes 2.

The games load quickly and they have a high-quality resolution with sharp graphics for an immersive gaming experience. Besides poker, this site has no shortage of casino games including the best Bitcoin slots, jackpot games and table games such as blackjack, roulette and baccarat. We also found a massive list of exclusive Bitcoin games here. Bonuses & Rewards: 4.6/5 Signing up at BitStarz as a new player earns you an attractive welcome bonus for up to four deposits. You get a 100% match bonus of up to 1 BTC on your first deposit with 180 free spins. Your second and third deposits earn you a 50% match up to 1 BTC and a 100% match up to 1 BTC on your fourth deposits. Each has a standard 40x rollover. There’s a welcome tournament for new players with a $1,000 prize pool for the top 200 players. Other bonuses include a 50% Monday Reload bonus and Wednesday Free Spins. Fan of no deposit bonuses? You can grab 20 free spins on their slots just for signing up. In fact, with the best Bitstarz bonus codes you can unlock some of the best promos in online poker. Banking Options: 4.3/ 5 It’s relatively easy to deposit with crypto to play poker at this site. You can use several cryptocurrencies to fund your wallet including Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and Ethereum. Though we’d love to see a bit more support for altcoins like Cardano, Avalanche, or even Shiba Inu we can’t help but love the fact the average crypto cashout takes less than 8 minutes. Mobile User Experience 4.5/5 Playing on your phone at BitStarz is a fantastic experience worth exploring. The mobile browser site is compatible with most operating systems and runs smoothly without lagging. You can access the entire BitStarz library on your smartphone or tablet easily. 3.

Naturally, your safest bet is transacting using crypto, as you can enjoy fast payouts within 24 hours at no extra charge. Rolling with fiat for online poker sites? Don’t, especially here.

You have 60 days to utilize the bonus and you’ll get $1 for every 27.5 Award Points earned ($5 in rake or tournament fees. We couldn’t find an exclusive Bitcoin bonus. However, several other offers make up for this. The leaderboard and the 27% rakeback for signing up with our links will suit many online poker players. Games Selection: 4.4/5 You won’t be disappointed by the poker collection at this casino. Texas Hold ‘Em is the most popular game, and players enjoy the limits that range from $0.02 up to $10. Pot Omaha also has flexible limits below $2 for players on a budget. Other options, such as Seven Card Stud, offer much-needed variety, although they are not overly common with players. Sit and Gos are also available with limits up to $100 in several forms, including six-max, heads up, and full ring Sit and Gos. We’re also loving their tournament menu with daily MTTs up to $75,000, and a jacked up Sunday menu featuring their signature $150,000 GTD. This is the place to give yourself a shot at decent Bitcoin poker winnings. Mobile User Experience: 3.6/5 You don’t have to download any software to play on this site’s mobile casino. With a stable internet connection, you can have online poker in the palm of your hand using most browsers, including Safari and Chrome. However, the limited selection of games on the mobile site can be frustrating. The non-download poker app includes only Blitz Poker, Jackpot Poker, and Venom Blitz Satellites. As with most platforms, we recommend you play online poker with Bitcoin using a computer here. Related: Best online casino bonus codes 4.

Playing online poker with cryptocurrency is never a sure thing, so finding a reliable site that’s not only got a rock solid reputation but has great cash game and tournament traffic is tough. Here’s why we’ve put Ignition in the number one spot: The Best MTTs Online: There are plenty of great spots here to try and take home a large payday including the Sunday $200,000 GTD. There are over $2,000,000 in tournaments weekly and they’ve even got some great events like the Black Diamond Poker Open and its $12,000,000 total prize pool. Soft Cash Game Traffic: Ignition’s anonymous tables mean you can’t get sniped by players with hand tracking software. Ignition also has a high volume of players coming over from the casino, which is a weaker quality of player compared to poker only sites. Amazing Crypto Perks: In addition to the $1,500 crypto welcome bonus, Bitcoin poker players can grab weekly boosts just for depositing with crypto: free spins, reload bonuses, tournament tickets, and more. Crypto Freerolls: Simply make a crypto deposit to play online poker during the week and you’ll get entry into a $2,500 freeroll exclusively for crypto players. Related: Best Online Casinos for Real Money Bitcoin Poker Online – FAQ Where Can I Play Poker with Bitcoin? Online poker sites that accept Bitcoin are almost everywhere these days, however for the sake of quality we are going to suggest Ignition Poker, Bitstarz, or Americas Cardroom to play crypto poker. Can I Register at More Than One Bitcoin Poker Site? Yes. There’s nothing wrong with having a player’s account with more than one provider. Having one site that suits all your preferences is the best in an ideal setting. However, this is rare so having accounts at different sites could work best for you. For example, you could use your Ignition account to play at its lucrative tournaments and have another account at America’s Cardroom to take advantage of the rakeback. Can I Win Real Money at Bitcoin Poker Sites? Yes, Bitcoin poker can earn you real cash. Although Bitcoin is not like regular cash, it has value in the real world. Bitcoin is a famous cryptocurrency and is accepted as a cash equivalent in many places. On the other hand, you can convert your Bitcoin winnings to fiat currency once you have withdrawn from your casino account. What Is The Difference Between Fixed Limit Poker Games And Limit? No limit and fixed limit are the two most common types of wagering structures in online poker. In fixed-limit games, players can only stake or raise a set amount with a lower and upper limit defined. Unlike fixed-limit games, no-limit games have no set wager limits. As long as a player has the required number of chips, they can stake or raise their preferred amount. Are Online Crypto Poker Tournaments Better Than Cash Games? No specific characteristic favors tournaments over cash games when playing poker. Both have their strengths and weaknesses. Most players choose one or the other out of personal preferences. Tournament-style games offer the thrill of competition over a specific duration as their crucial feature alongside hefty rewards.

But where Ignition truly shines is their poker. Their system runs great on PC and on any mobile device, is loaded with a ton of features, and provides a better poker experience than most face-to-face games we’ve played. We’re also huge fans of Ignition’s tournaments. Whether you’re interested in the Monthly Milly tournament (a $1 million prize pool monthly) or the fast-paced Knockout Tournaments (every player has a bounty on their head), you’ll find a poker experience better than anything other online crypto casinos can provide.

This exciting slot title features Day of the Dead stylings, phenomenal artwork, and a wealth of free spins.

    title: "The Amazing Benefits Of Bitcoin ATMs - WorldNewsEra",
    text: "Did you know that Bitcoin had a market capitalization of $1072.21 billion as of February 21st, 2021? People are often hesitant to use new technology, especially when it comes to their money. Even though Bitcoin has been around for a while, there are still a lot of people who don’t understand it or are afraid to use it. Bitcoin ATMs offer an easy and convenient way to buy and sell bitcoins. They are available in over 70 countries and can be used with any type of currency. But that’s not all. Keep reading to see all of the amazing benefits of bitcoin! What Are Bitcoin ATMs? Bitcoin ATMs are automated teller machines that allow you to purchase Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies with cash. Unlike traditional ATMs, a Bitcoin ATM does not require a bank account, and it can be used to buy and sell Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. You can find Bitcoin ATMs by going to ByteFederal.com. Benefits of Using a Bitcoin ATM There are many benefits of using a Bitcoin ATM. They include: Convenience Convenience is one of the key factors that drive consumer behavior. We are constantly looking for ways to make our lives easier, and we are willing to pay a premium for products and services that save us time and effort. This is why Bitcoin ATMs are so popular. By locating these machines in convenient locations, such as grocery stores or gas stations, they make it easy for consumers to buy Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies without having to go to a bank or exchange. This convenience comes at a price, however. Bitcoin ATMs typically charge high fees, which can eat into your profits if you’re not careful. But for many people, the convenience is worth the price. Anonymity The anonymity afforded by Bitcoin ATMs can be beneficial for several reasons. For one, it helps to protect your privacy. Unlike traditional ATMs, which require you to input personal information, Bitcoin ATMs do not collect any data about you. Your identity remains confidential, and your transaction history cannot be traced back to you. In addition, anonymity can also help to reduce fraud. Since there is no way to track who is using a Bitcoin ATM, criminals cannot use it to launder money or commit other illegal activities. As a result, anonymity is one of the critical advantages of using a Bitcoin ATM. Safety Bitcoin ATMs are a safe and convenient way to buy or sell bitcoins. Most Bitcoin ATMs have built-in security features, such as cameras and fingerprint scanners, that make them more secure than traditional ATMs. Additionally, Bitcoin ATMs allow you to transact without having to meet someone in person, which reduces the risk of fraud or theft. While there are some risks associated with using Bitcoin ATMs, such as the possibility of being scammed or hacked, these risks can be minimized by using only reputable ATMs and taking precautions such as not sharing your private key or PIN with anyone. Speed Speed is one of the major selling points of Bitcoin ATMs. Unlike traditional financial institutions, which can take days or even weeks to process transactions, Bitcoin ATMs can typically get you your cryptocurrency within minutes. This makes them ideal for people who need to quickly and easily convert their fiat currency into Bitcoin or other digital assets. What’s more, because Bitcoin ATMs are powered by blockchain technology, they’re also much more efficient than traditional ATMs, which means that you won’t have to wait in line as long to get your money. So if you’re looking for a fast and convenient way to buy or sell cryptocurrency, a Bitcoin ATM is probably your best bet. No Banks Required Bitcoin ATMs are a great alternative for those who don’t have a bank account or who prefer to use a more decentralized form of currency. Bitcoin ATMs allow you to buy and sell Bitcoin without the need for a bank account. This is because Bitcoin is a decentralized currency that is not regulated by any government or financial institution. Bitcoin ATMs are also convenient because they can be found in many locations around the world. So, whether you’re looking to buy Bitcoin while you’re on vacation or you want to find a local Bitcoin ATM near you, there’s sure to be one nearby. Benefits of Bitcoin Now that you know the benefits of using a Bitcoin ATM, let’s take a look at some of the benefits of Bitcoin itself. Let’s look at them now: Anonymity As we mentioned before, one of the great things about Bitcoin is that it allows you to remain anonymous. When you use Bitcoin, your personal information is not attached to your transaction. This is in contrast to traditional methods of payment, such as credit cards or bank transfers, which do require you to provide your personal information. Decentralization Another benefit of Bitcoin is that it is decentralized. This means that it is not regulated by any government or financial institution. Instead, it is managed by a network of computers around the world. This decentralization makes Bitcoin incredibly resistant to censorship or manipulation. Speed Speed is one of the most important factors to consider when choosing a payment method. For many people, time is of the essence, and they need to be able to receive their payments quickly. This is where Bitcoin shines. Bitcoin transactions are fast. They can be completed in minutes, and sometimes even seconds. This is much faster than traditional methods of payment, such as bank transfers, which can take days to complete. This makes Bitcoin an ideal choice for anyone who needs to receive payments quickly and efficiently. Low Fees One of the big advantages of Bitcoin is that it has low fees. When you make a Bitcoin transaction, you only need to pay a small fee. This fee goes to the miners who verify the transaction on the Bitcoin network. These fees are typically a lot lower than the fees charged by traditional financial institutions, such as banks or credit card companies. This makes Bitcoin a great choice for those who want to send or receive money without paying high fees. Another advantage of Bitcoin is that it’s fast. When you make a Bitcoin transaction, it is typically confirmed within a few minutes. This is much faster than traditional banking systems, which can take days or even weeks to process a payment. Ease of Use Bitcoin is often touted as being a more user-friendly alternative to traditional money. After all, there are no complicated forms to fill out or approval processes to go through. You can just start using Bitcoin right away. However, it’s important to remember that Bitcoin is still a new and relatively untested technology. That means there are some potential risks involved in using Bitcoin. So, if you’re thinking about using Bitcoin, be sure to do your research and only use Bitcoin wallets that you trust. With a little bit of care, you can enjoy all the advantages of Bitcoin without having to worry about any of the potential dangers. Risks of Bitcoin Now that we’ve looked at the benefits of Bitcoin, let’s take a look at some of the risks. They include: Volatility One of the biggest risks of investing in Bitcoin is its volatility. The price of Bitcoin has been known to fluctuate wildly, and it can be incredibly difficult to predict where it will go next. This volatility can make it hard to use Bitcoin as a currency because its value can change so much from one day to the next. It also makes it risky to invest in Bitcoin, because you could end up losing money if the price goes down. Security Risks There are a few different security risks to consider when it comes to Bitcoin. One is the risk of losing your Bitcoin wallet. If you lose your wallet, or if it is stolen, you could lose all of your Bitcoin. This is why it’s important to keep your wallet safe and secure, and to only store a small amount of Bitcoin in it. Another risk to consider is the risk of hacking. If someone hacks into your Bitcoin wallet, they could steal your Bitcoin. This is why it’s important to choose a strong password for your wallet, and to never share your password with anyone. Learn More About the Benefits of Bitcoin With all of these benefits of bitcoin, it’s no wonder that the Bitcoin ATM industry is expected to grow exponentially in the next few years.

      "Best Bitcoin Casino Sites: Updated List of the Top Bitcoin Casinos Ranked by BTC Games, Bonuses, and More",
    text: "Sponsored Content Unique games, generous bonuses, and instant payouts – we’re talking about the best Bitcoin casinos, of course. And guess what? We’ve got a list of them here! Our experts did the research and singled out only the top BTC casinos. These top-ranked crypto casinos put amazing bonuses and an equally gigantic library of casino games at your fingertips. Bitstarz was our #1 pick this time around, but we’ve got 11 competitors willing to compete with them. Ready? Let’s go. Best Bitcoin Casinos Bitstarz: Best overall Ignition: Best for poker 7Bit: Best for progressive jackpots Red Dog: Top pick for live casino games Punt Crypto: Top choice for slots BC.Game: Best no deposit bonuses Cloudbet: Top pick for crypto betting mBit: Highest number of games Everygame: Great crypto sportsbook Slots Empire: Best slots promos Slots.lv: Top pick for specialty games Las Atlantis: Best new BTC casino 1. Bitstarz – Best Bitcoin Casino Overall Pros: 3,952 crypto casino games Bitcoin casino bonus of up to 5 BTC 20 no-deposit free spins 180 free spins with first deposit 5 modes of customer support Cons Live dealer games not available in some countries Players in search of the best overall experience will find it here at Bitstarz. It’s impossible to go wrong with nearly 4,000 casino games, huge welcome bonuses, and phenomenal customer support! Gaming Variety: 4.9/5 Bitstarz hosts a staggering 3,952 crypto casino games, and they’re consistently adding more titles to their already-stuffed gaming library. If you’re looking for unparalleled variety, there’s always something new to explore here. We encountered nearly 1,000 classic reels and 684 exclusive Bitcoin slots from 46 software providers. However, their 150+ live casino games are geo-restricted in some countries. Thankfully, they carry tens of video poker, blackjack, baccarat, and roulette variants that serve as effective replacements for most players. Their varied selection of online table games utilizes immersive, 3D graphics to provide a hyper-realistic experience. Welcome Bonus & Promotions: 5/5 Upon creating a new account and verifying your email address with Bitstarz, you’ll receive 20 free spins – no deposit required. That said, Bitstarz’ premier welcome bonus is where it’s at. They’ll double your first deposit all the way up to 1 BTC, and you’ll get another 180 free spins that make this bonus pot taste even sweeter. Your free spins can be used across a range of their most popular Bitcoin slots, and they’ll make satisfying the wagering requirements that much easier. >> More Bitstarz Casino bonus codes Payment Options: 4.8/5 Players can bank their funds using Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Ethereum. They also take credit card and e-wallet deposits in some countries, but fiat bettors will get a much less generous bonus match. To start wagering, you can deposit as little as 0.0002 BTC to your account. However, to claim your 1 BTC deposit bonus, you’ll need to fund your account with 0.001 BTC or more. In order to redeem your 180 free spins, this minimum jumps to 0.006 BTC. Players will enjoy instant, fee-free payouts when they gamble with Bitstarz. Winners can move anywhere from 0.0002 BTC to 10 BTC off-site per transaction, and you’ll see your funds delivered in 10 minutes or less. Customer Support: 5/5 Bitstarz makes it incredibly easy for all players to get in touch with their team of representatives. You can reach out by phone, send their team a live chat request, or contact them via email. Additionally; they make their representatives available on Facebook and Twitter. They encourage public discussion, and they frequently reply to hashtagged posts with much-needed assistance. Alternatively, you can send their team a DM for a quicker response. No matter which method of communication you choose, you can expect fast response times and professional team members that go the extra mile. Click here to play online casino games with Bitstarz and get your welcome bonus up to 5 BTC >> Read our in-depth Bitstarz Casino review 2. Ignition Casino – Best Bitcoin Casino for Poker Pros: High-traffic poker site Great live dealer casino with 35+ tables Welcome bonus up to $3,000 Weekly crypto boost All games available on mobile Cons: No free spins bonuses Our runner-up to the best Bitcoin online casino is Ignition, one of the most popular poker sites that offer crypto compatibility. Let’s find out more about it. Gaming Variety: 4.9/5 If you know anything about Ignition, the first thing that comes to mind when you hear about it is probably poker – and it’s no wonder. With high-traffic poker tournaments, anonymous tables so sharks can’t eat you, and great poker bonuses, it definitely deserves the title. Is that all it does well, though? Definitely not. Ignition is a well-rounded crypto gambling site, filled to the brim with the latest online slots, table games, and even jackpot titles. We particularly liked its live Bitcoin casino section that offers flexible wagering limits and a couple of unique tables like Early Payout Blackjack. Welcome Bonus & Promotions: 4.8/5 New players can grab a combined casino & poker welcome bonus at Ignition – a 200% deposit match up to $2,000. But that’s not where the fun ends: It gets even better if you use cryptos – and that’s what you’re here for, right? New Bitcoin casino players can get a higher deposit match (300%) and it goes all the way up to $3,000. Payment Options: 4.5/5 Ignition accepts the following cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Tether, and Litecoin. A longer list of altcoins would have been nice, but at least all the usual suspects are here. Oh, and unlike many other Bitcoin gambling sites, Ignition also supports fiat payments, meaning you can use your credit card if you run out of cryptos. Customer Support: 4.9/5 Ignition’s Help Center is one of the most comprehensive FAQ sources we found as far as the best Bitcoin casinos are concerned. There’s also the added benefit of Ignition’s Forum, where you can chat with other players like you, while the live chat option remains available 24/7. Grab your welcome bonus up to $3,000 >> Read our honest Ignition Casino review 3. 7Bit – Best Crypto Casino for Progressive Jackpot Games Pros 135 progressive jackpots 1,200+ classic reels Up to 5 BTC in bonus funds 100 free spins with first deposit Low deposit & withdrawal minimums Cons No phone support Geo-restricted live dealer games Jackpot hunters in search of a huge crypto payday should spin the reels with 7Bit Casino. They’ve got 135 high-multiplier progressives and 1,200 classic machines to keep you occupied! Gaming Variety: 4.6/5 7Bit is designed with big fish hunters in mind. 93% of their gaming library is slots-based, and we counted out 135 high-payout jackpots from 23 different software providers! While we didn’t find any conventionally popular progressives, we came across plenty of six-digit multipliers and seven-digit machines. Our favorite reel here was Farmville 2 – this light-hearted, 25-payline machine can net you 10,000x your line bet. If you get tired of spinning for big bucks, 7Bit has 1,200+ classic reels on tap. However, they don’t have very many table games to choose from, even though all the bases, like roulette, blackjack, and baccarat are present here. Welcome Bonus & Promotions: 4.8/5 7Bit’s welcome bonus is among the largest we’ve seen, and it’s easily accessible for new sign-ups right now. Use the promo code “ACEBONUS” with your first crypto deposit, and 7Bit will give you a 177% casino match worth up to 5 BTC. You’ll also receive 100 free spins to use across twenty of 7Bit’s most popular crypto reels. >> More 7Bit Casino bonus codes Payment Options: 4.2/5 7Bit accepts a wide range of crypto and fiat currencies, but crypto players can bank their funds here using BTC, LTC, Bitcoin Cash, DOGE, ETH, USDT, Ripple, TRON, Cardano, or Binance Coin. We were impressed with their accessible deposit minimums. You’ll need to fund your casino account with just 0.0001 BTC to begin wagering and claim your deposit bonus. In the same vein, you can withdraw as little as 0.0002 BTC or as much as 10 BTC in one shot. Much like Bitstarz, 7Bit offers instant, 100% fee-free payouts that reach your crypto wallet in 5-10 minutes. Customer Support: 4.4/5 If you need to get in touch with somebody at 7Bit Casino, you’ll have to use their website’s native contact form or send them an email. Although representatives are available to answer your inquiries 24/7, they don’t offer live chat or phone support. We’re happy to report that 7Bit handles response times exceptionally well. Click here to get started at 7Bit 4. Red Dog – Best Bitcoin Casino Online for Live Games Pros: 13 live casino games Versatile pricing fits any budget Generous reload bonuses 320% Slots Bonus 156+ BTC casino games Cons: $150 withdrawal minimum Although Red Dog was a mere puppy back in 2019; they’ve become a top Bitcoin casino for live dealer games just 3 years later. Many crypto casinos don’t offer unrestricted live dealer games, but Red Dog runs ahead of the pack. Gaming Variety: 4.6/5 Alongside 120+ RTG-fueled Bitcoin slots, skill players can explore 13 live tables that include several variants of blackjack, baccarat, and roulette. Powered by Visionary iGaming, their live tables mimic an “in-person” betting experience with lower table minimums and a much higher degree of convenience. 6 blackjack games are available from $5 to $2,500, and 2 early payout options can give you the upper hand. American and European roulette wheels accompany wagers from $1 to $1,000, while baccarat and Super 6 games can be played for just $5. Welcome Bonus & Promotions: 4.7/5 Red Dog’s premier welcome bonus will triple your first deposit with no limits. Use the code “REDCOIN” with any one of your first 5 deposits to redeem their 320% slots bonus. Players can get a piece of the action with as little as $20 deposited upfront, and there aren’t any upper limits. You can withdraw 30x the amount of your original deposit. High rollers may want to pad their accounts with more upfront, but this bonus is accessible enough for just about every online gambler. Payment Options: 4.65 Red Dog Casino accepts deposits made through BTC, ETH, LTC, and Tether. Alternatively, fiat players can use their credit cards, NeoSurf, or Flexepin. No matter which form of currency you choose, you’ll have to deposit the equivalent of $20 to qualify for their bonus. However, their minimum withdrawal requirements aren’t so forgiving. While all deposits and withdrawals are 100% fee-free, you can’t cash out with less than $150 in winnings. Thankfully, cashouts are fast across the board. Crypto withdrawals take just under 24 hours to process and deliver, while fiat payouts take 2-3 days to clear. Customer Support: 4.8/5 Red Dog offers 24/7 support through 3 common channels. If you need to get in touch with somebody who can help, their team is available 24/7. Players can reach out via email, phone, or live chat for instant help. We waited on hold for 10 minutes before speaking with a real person, and we received an email reply in just under 12 hours. Overall, they respond quickly and professionally to all inquiries. It’s nice to see a newer casino take their customer service seriously, and they get extra points in this department! Click here to get the best Red Dog Casino bonuses 5. Punt Casino – Best Bitcoin Casino for Slots Pros: Mobile-optimized Secure, instant crypto payouts Provably fair slots, blackjack & roulette Beginner-friendly guides Cons: No phone support No live dealer games If you’re ready to play at one of the best slots sites, check out Punt Casino. Gaming Variety: 4/5 This crypto casino is home to tens of exclusive titles that cover every end of the gaming spectrum. We came across a few high-paying jackpot slots that include multiplayer coverage, so you and up to 19 other people can compete for a progressively rising prize pot in real-time. You can claim your seat with $1 wagers or bet up to $10,000 per spin to increase your winning chances/ Blackjack, video poker, and roulette are the only real table games here, but you won’t find any live dealer options. However, if you’re looking for something unique, their exclusive BTC games fit the bill. Welcome Bonus & Promotions: 4.5/5 Cryptopunt doesn’t have many traditional casino bonuses to speak of. Unlike most Bitcoin casino gambling sites, it focuses on weekly promos. It lets you claim a “no max” bonus throughout the week and claim a 300% bonus and free spins on their chosen game of the week. If you’re looking for rather unique bonuses you can claim overtime, Cryptopunt delivers in spades. Payment Options: 4.6/5 This crypto casino takes direct Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash deposits. There are no stated deposit minimums with Cryptopunt; which makes this BTC casino all the more accessible to players with tighter budgets. Similarly, you’ll enjoy 100% fee-free payouts to your crypto wallet of choice. Much like Bitstarz, Cryptopunt prioritizes lightning-fast withdrawals. Payouts can take up to 1 hour for processing and delivery, but most players receive their winnings in 10 minutes or less. Customer Support: 4.6/5 Cryptopunt doesn’t offer phone support, but you can speak to one of their customer support agents via live chat. They are responsive and friendly and we have no complaints here. Click here to sign up to Punt Casino and claim the best bonuses 6. BC Game – Best Bonuses of any Bitcoin Online Casino Site Pros No-deposit bonus wheel Win up to 1 BTC every day 6,000+ slots and table games Accepts 80+ cryptocurrencies Dice games & Bitcoin poker Cons 3.8% crypto payout fee No phone or email support If you’ve been feeling lucky lately, BC Game is ready to put your fate to the test. Every day, you’ll spin their bonus wheel for a chance to win up to 1 BTC. Gaming Variety: 4.5/5 BC Game houses 6,000+ slots and table games with one caveat. Around half of their games aren’t playable in some countries, which puts them on par with Bitstarz in terms of their available selection. So, with 3,000 games to play through on average (depending on where you’re from), BC Game represents a slice of heaven for crypto slot spinners. Their casino library is composed of penny slots, ultra-popular classics, and progressive jackpots alike. We also found a few specialty dice games, tens of video poker variants, and high-limit blackjack tables that use the latest in modern technology. Welcome Bonus & Promotions: 5/5 BC Game’s daily bonus wheel is equipped to the max. With maximum winnings that can get as high as 1 BTC for existing players, it’s certainly the main attraction here. Every 24 hours, you’ll have one chance to spin their bonus wheel. While you can redeem a few steady deposit bonuses, your funds are unlocked as you continue placing wagers on their site. Transactions of $30 or more will receive an 80% bonus, while $80 deposits are doubled off the bat. Finally, deposits of $400 or more are credited with a 180% casino match. Payment Options: 4.9/5 BC Game accepts 80+ cryptocurrencies, and there are no stated deposit minimums unless you’re redeeming one of their percentage-based matches. That being said, you can spin their bonus wheel before you spend a penny playing casino games. Their site also doubles as a crypto exchange, so you can convert altcoins into stablecoins (and vice versa) for free! You can cash out as little as 0.000728 BTC in one shot, and there are no maximum deposit limits. Customer Support: 4/5 BC Game is a fairly new casino, so we’ll cut them some slack here. They don’t have a dedicated phone line or email option for players to contact; so you’ll have to send their team a live chat if you need assistance. That being said, there’s someone waiting on the other end of the screen 24/7. They boast industry-leading response times, and you’ll never be left stranded. Within seconds of sending BC Game a live chat request, we received a detailed reply. Click here to claim the best BC Game bonuses 7. Cloudbet Casino – Most Accepted Cryptocurrencies of all Bitcoin Casinos Multiple cryptocurrencies allowed Good crypto welcome bonus No withdrawal limits Cloudbet Casino is another known crypto casino site, which has been running since 2013. The casino bolsters a valid online gambling license from Curacao, and it uses the latest SSL encryption technology on the site. Besides the fair offer of cryptocurrency payments, Cloudbet offers a nice crypto welcome promotion for new players. The welcome bonus consists of a 100% match deposit of up to 5 BTC/BHC/ETH/PAXG, all depending on the cryptocurrency in use. When speaking about the best crypto casino sites, we can’t go on without mentioning the withdrawal limits from crypto payments. Cloudbet does not have limits on withdrawals, which means that gamers can withdraw how much they want. This casino is also one of the few crypto casinos that support almost all cryptocurrency available, including BTC, BCH, ETH, PAXG, USDT, USDC, DAI, PAX, LINK, DOGE, DASH or LTC. Cloudbet Casino might be more sports betting-orientated, but they do offer great live table games in the casino section. They could use more game providers though as there are only Betsoft and Playson supplying their casino games at the moment. 8. mBit Casino – Best Variety of Bitcoin Casino Games Bitcoin welcome bonus Over 900 bitcoin games Refer To A Friend promotion mBit Casino is an online gambling venue that went live in 2014. It’s a strictly crypto only casino which supports BTC, BCH, ETH, DOGE, USDT, and LTC. So far, crypto gamers can enjoy over 900 bitcoin games, spread in multiple game categories. This crypto casino site is predominantly composed of slots, and some of the most prominent titles are ‘Diamond Riches’ and ‘Colossus Fruits.’ The Bitcoin welcome bonus is definitely eye-catching for a lot of cryptoplayers. The package consists of three separate deposits. The first deposit bonus is a 110% matching of up to 1 BTC and 300 free spins. The second part rewards players with 50% of up to 2.5 BTC, and the last deposit bonus consists of 75% of up to 1.5 BTC. The ‘Refer To a Friend’ reward deal is another interesting feature at mBit Casino. This promotion allows the player to invite some of their friends, and both of them will receive 300 free spins and a special 30% deposit bonus. mBit’s main feature may also be its biggest downside as only crypto players are allowed here. 9. Everygame Casino – Best Welcome Bonuses of all Bitcoin Casinos Unique mobile reward New game promotions 10x wagering requirements on free spins Everygame Casino is widely known for its welcome bonus promotions. Players can get 125% up to $1000 on their first deposit. The casino also offers a special mobile reward for its players worth up to $100 every week. The minimum deposit for this promotion is $50.

Slots.lv supports Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV, Litecoin, and Ethereum.

Las Atlantis Casino – Best New BTC Casino New game promotions Specialty bonuses Several slots promotions One of the best new Bitcoin casinos Last Atlantis Casino is known across the market for its slot promotions.

Bitcoin and Ethereum are supported in this casino. There are no fees for all payout options and there is no limit to the deposits made through cryptocurrencies.

      "Bitcoin Trading vs Investing: What&#8217;s the Difference and which is better?",
    text: "Bitcoin has become one of the hottest topics in the financial world. Its explosive growth and volatility have captured the attention of investors and traders alike, who are seeking to take advantage of its potential for high returns. However, with so many different ways to get involved in Bitcoin Freedom, it can be confusing to know where to start. In this article, we’ll explore the differences between Bitcoin trading and investing and help you decide which one is better for you. Bitcoin trading involves buying and selling Bitcoin in the short term with the goal of making a profit from price fluctuations. Traders try to predict the future price of Bitcoin based on market trends, news events, and technical analysis, and then make trades accordingly. Bitcoin investing, on the other hand, is a long-term strategy where investors hold Bitcoin for an extended period of time, usually years, with the goal of profiting from the overall growth of the cryptocurrency. In this article, we’ll provide an overview of Bitcoin Trading vs Investing, including the advantages and risks of each approach, as well as tips for successful trading and investing. We’ll also examine the differences between trading and investing, including mindset, time horizon, and risk management. Finally, we’ll help you decide which one is better for you based on your personal preferences and risk tolerance. Bitcoin Trading Bitcoin trading is the process of buying and selling Bitcoin for profit. It involves speculating on the price movements of Bitcoin in the hope of making a profit. The goal of Bitcoin trading is to buy low and sell high, making a profit on the difference in price. To trade Bitcoin, you need to open an account on a Bitcoin exchange, which is an online platform that allows users to buy and sell Bitcoin. Once you have an account, you can deposit funds into it using various payment methods, such as bank transfer or credit card. To make a trade, you need to place an order on the exchange. There are two types of orders: buy and sell. A buy order is used when you want to purchase Bitcoin, while a sell order is used when you want to sell Bitcoin. You can choose to place a market order, which is executed at the current market price, or a limit order, which is executed at a specified price. Bitcoin trading has its pros and cons. One of the advantages of trading Bitcoin is that it can be a quick way to make a profit. If you time your trades correctly, you can make a significant profit in a short amount of time. Another advantage is that Bitcoin trading is accessible to anyone with an internet connection and a computer or mobile device. However, Bitcoin trading also has its risks. The price of Bitcoin is highly volatile and can fluctuate rapidly, making it challenging to predict the future price movements. Additionally, there is the risk of losing your investment if the price of Bitcoin goes down instead of up. Bitcoin Investing Bitcoin investing is the process of buying Bitcoin with the intention of holding onto it for the long term. The goal of Bitcoin investing is to profit from the potential increase in the value of Bitcoin over time. To invest in Bitcoin, you need to open a Bitcoin wallet, which is a digital wallet that allows you to store, send, and receive Bitcoin. Once you have a wallet, you can purchase Bitcoin from a Bitcoin exchange or a peer-to-peer trading platform. Bitcoin investing has its pros and cons. One of the advantages of investing in Bitcoin is that it can be a way to diversify your investment portfolio. Bitcoin has historically had a low correlation with traditional asset classes, such as stocks and bonds, which means it can potentially provide a hedge against market volatility. Another advantage of investing in Bitcoin is that it has a finite supply. There will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins in existence, which means that as demand for Bitcoin increases, the price is likely to increase as well. However, Bitcoin investing also has its risks. The price of Bitcoin is highly volatile and can fluctuate rapidly, which means that it’s possible to lose money if you sell your Bitcoin during a downturn. Additionally, Bitcoin is not regulated by any government or financial institution, which means that there is a risk of fraud and theft. Differences between Bitcoin Trading and Investing The main difference between Bitcoin trading and investing is the time horizon. Bitcoin trading is focused on short-term profits, while Bitcoin investing is focused on long-term gains. Bitcoin trading involves buying and selling Bitcoin frequently, with the goal of making a profit on the price fluctuations. Traders use technical analysis, market trends, and news events to predict the price movements of Bitcoin and make trades accordingly. On the other hand, Bitcoin investing involves buying and holding onto Bitcoin for the long term, with the belief that its value will increase over time. Investors tend to rely on fundamental analysis, such as the adoption of Bitcoin by businesses and individuals, to assess the potential long-term value of Bitcoin. Another difference between Bitcoin trading and investing is the level of risk. Bitcoin trading is considered more risky than investing, as traders are exposed to the high volatility of Bitcoin’s price and the potential for quick losses. Investing, on the other hand, is considered less risky, as investors have a long-term outlook and are less affected by short-term price fluctuations. Additionally, Bitcoin trading and investing require different skill sets. Trading requires a deep understanding of market trends, technical analysis, and risk management, while investing requires a focus on fundamental analysis and a long-term perspective. Tips for Bitcoin Trading and Investing Whether you choose to trade or invest in Bitcoin, there are several tips that can help you make the most of your investment. Here are some tips to consider: Do your research: Before investing in Bitcoin, it’s important to do your research and understand the risks involved. Research the technology behind Bitcoin, its history, and the factors that can affect its price. Diversify your portfolio: If you decide to invest in Bitcoin, consider diversifying your portfolio with other asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and real estate. This can help reduce your overall risk and increase your chances of success. Set realistic goals: Whether you’re trading or investing, it’s important to set realistic goals for yourself. Don’t expect to get rich overnight, and be prepared for both gains and losses. Use a secure wallet: If you’re holding onto Bitcoin, make sure to use a secure wallet to store your coins. This can help protect you from theft and fraud. Follow market trends: Keep an eye on market trends and news events that can affect the price of Bitcoin. This can help you make informed trading or investing decisions. Practice risk management: If you’re trading Bitcoin, it’s important to practice risk management to minimize your losses. Set stop-loss orders, use leverage responsibly, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Conclusion In conclusion, Bitcoin trading and investing are two different approaches to making money from Bitcoin. Trading is focused on short-term gains, while investing is focused on long-term growth. Both approaches have their own risks and rewards, and it’s important to choose the one that best fits your investment goals and risk tolerance. If you’re interested in Bitcoin trading, make sure to do your research and practice risk management to minimize your losses. Keep an eye on market trends and news events that can affect the price of Bitcoin, and consider using technical analysis to make informed trading decisions.

    title: "These Are All the Bitcoin ETFs That Are Now Trading in the US",
    text: "Since the first application for a U.S. Bitcoin exchange-traded fund was filed in 2013, a spot Bitcoin ETF has become something of a holy grail for the crypto community. And now it’s finally here. An ETF is a publicly traded investment vehicle that tracks the value of an underlying asset; in the case of a Bitcoin ETF, that asset is Bitcoin. Advocates for a Bitcoin ETF argue that the complexities of exchanges, crypto wallets, and private keys still present a daunting barrier to entry into the crypto space for newcomers. A Bitcoin ETF would enable these investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without actually having to hold their own cryptocurrency. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first batch of 10 spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 10, and they all began trading on January 11. Here’s a rundown of all of the spot Bitcoin ETFs currently trading in the States, along with a look at futures ETFs and how they vary. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) In June 2023, the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock—with over $9 trillion in assets under management as of Q1 2023—shocked the TradFi world when it filed an application for a Bitcoin spot ETF. Now live on NASDAQ, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is one of the highest-profile Bitcoin ETFs on the market, and has a 0.25% standard fee. However, BlackRock is cutting the fee to 0.12% for the first $5 billion in assets or 12 months, whichever comes first. BlackRock is using Coinbase as its crypto custodian and spot market data provider, with BNY Mellon as the cash custodian. The firm also named JP Morgan Securities, Jane Street Capital, Macquarie Capital, and Virtu Americas as authorized participants. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) Crypto investment fund manager Grayscale's GBTC Bitcoin trust managed well over 600,000 BTC (worth nearly $28 billion at today's prices), and it made no secret of its desire to convert the trust into a full-fledged Bitcoin spot ETF. In fact, it was Grayscale’s legal push that helped turn the tide at the SEC, as Chair Gary Gensler begrudgingly admitted. As a proper ETF listed on NYSE Arca, GBTC has the highest fee of any of the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs at 1.5%, which is actually down slightly from the 2% GBTC fee before the conversion. Analysts suggest the high fee may be a measure to keep GBTC owners from dumping shares to switch to another ETF, due to the potential for a significant tax hit. Grayscale may also be betting that its lengthy track record and immense BTC holdings will keep investors from looking elsewhere, despite the high fee. Coinbase serves as the crypto custodian and index provider, with BNY Mellon as administrator. Jane Street, Virtu Americas, Macquarie Capital, and ABN AMRO Clearing are authorized participants. Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) March 2021 saw a rush of applications for Bitcoin ETFs, among them Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust—perhaps unsurprisingly, given that mere weeks earlier its Director of Global Macro, Jurrien Timmer, said that Bitcoin has a \"unique advantage\" over gold. Uniquely, Fidelity has opted to self-custody the Bitcoin underlying the ETF, rather than using Coinbase or Gemini. The Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust trades on Cboe’s BZX and has a standard fee of 0.25%, but Fidelity is waiving it until August 1, 2024. Authorized participants include Jane Street, JP Morgan Securities, Macquaries, and Virtu Americas. Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) Bitwise first filed for its spot Bitcoin ETF filing back in October 2019, but was, like many other applications, rejected by the SEC. But Bitwise persevered, and was the first hopeful to launch an ad campaign relating to a Bitcoin ETF, enlisting actor Jonathan Goldsmith—well known for portraying “The Most Interesting Man in the World” for beer company Dos Equis—to deliver its “Bitwise is Interesting” message. Now live on NYSE Arca, the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF has the lowest fee of any current spot offering at 0.20%—but Bitwise is waiving its fee entirely for the first $1 billion worth of assets or a six-month period, whichever comes first. Coinbase is the crypto custodian, while BNY Mellon is both the administrator and the trust custodian. Jane Street, Macquarie, and Virtu Americas are all authorized participants. WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund (BTCW) New York-based asset manager WisdomTree already has experience running a Bitcoin ETF; it launched one on Switzerland's SIX stock exchange back in 2019. It joined the ranks of U.S. Bitcoin ETF hopefuls in March 2021, filing an S-1 with the SEC that proposed listing shares in the WisdomTree Bitcoin Trust on the Cboe BZX Exchange under the ticker BTCW. Now listed on Cboe under the BTCW ticker, the WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund has a 0.3% standard fee, although like Bitwise, the firm is waiving that entirely for the first six months or until $1 billion worth of assets are traded (whichever is sooner). Coinbase is once more the crypto custodian here, while State Street Bank and Trust is the administrator and cash custodian. Jane Street, Virtu Americas, and Macquarie Capital have signed on as authorized participants. Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO) Galaxy Digital and Invesco filed for a joint Bitcoin ETF in September 2021, called the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF. According to that filing, its ETF would also be “physically backed” by Bitcoin rather than via derivatives like futures. Invesco is the fourth-largest ETF provider in the United States, so it has a lengthy track record ahead of the Bitcoin rollout. The Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO) is now trading on Cboe BZX with a standard fee of 0.39%, though like others on this list, the companies are covering all sponsor fees for the first six months of operation up to $5 billion worth of assets. BNY Mellon is the transfer agent and cash custodian, while Coinbase will handle crypto custody. JP Morgan Securities, Jane Street, Virtu Americas, and Marex Capital Markets are authorized participants. Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund (BRRR) A relatively recent entrant to the race, asset manager Valkyrie filed its first application for a Bitcoin ETF in January 2021. Now the Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund is live using the ticker BRRR—an amusing allusion to the “money printer goes brrr” meme that refers to the Federal Reserve pumping the economy full of cash. It’s sure to please some Bitcoin die-hards. Trading on the NASDAQ, the ETF has a standard fee of 0.25% but Valkyrie is fully waiving its sponsor fee for three months. The Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund uses Coinbase as prime broker and Bitcoin custodian, while U.S. Bank is the cash custodian. Jane Street and Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. have signed on as authorized participants. Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) Ark Invest, the investment firm led by Cathie Wood, filed its application for the Ark 21Shares ETF in June 2021. Ark Invest has partnered with Swiss-based ETF provider 21Shares AG to offer the Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF; it trades on Cboe's BZX Exchange under the ticker symbol ARKB. The ARKB ETF nearly matches Bitwise’s low fee at 0.21%, and like others, the companies are waiving the sponsor fee entirely for six months or until it hits $1 billion in assets, whichever comes first. Coinbase is the crypto custodian, while Jane Street, Macquarie, and Virtu Americas are authorized participants. VanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL) VanEck is one of the earliest Bitcoin ETF applicants. Its first stab at a Bitcoin ETF—the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust, in partnership with SolidX—came all the way back in 2018. The “HODL” ticker refers to common Bitcoin lingo; it dates back to a panicked misspelling of the word “hold” in a 2013 BitcoinTalk forum post. VanEck is also donating 5% of fund profits to Bitcoin core developers. Where the majority of other applicants have named Coinbase as the custodian of the Bitcoin underpinning their ETFs, VanEck has instead opted for rival exchange Gemini to custody its Bitcoin. The VanEck Bitcoin Trust trades on Cboe and has a 0.25% fee, with Jane Street, Virtu Americas, and ABN AMRO Clearing signed as authorized participants. Franklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC) Franklin Templeton, one of the world’s largest asset managers with around $1.4 trillion in assets under management, joined the race for a spot Bitcoin ETF in September 2023. The ETF’s shares are listed on the Cboe BZX exchange—and, like the majority of applicants, crypto exchange Coinbase is the fund’s custodian. Using the ticker EZBC, the Franklin Bitcoin ETF is available now with a fee of 0.29%, putting it near the middle of the pack for the current crop of spot ETFs. There’s no apparent discount for early investors. Jane Street and Virtu Americas are listed as authorized participants. What about Hashdex? The largest crypto asset management firm in Latin America, Hashdex, entered the fray in August 2023, with a proposal to convert its existing Bitcoin futures ETF to a spot ETF. Despite claiming that it would begin trading as a spot ETF right away, Hashdex announced Thursday afternoon that the Hashdex Bitcoin Futures ETF (DEFI) transition will happen at a later date. Hashdex employs an unusual strategy that sets it apart from other spot Bitcoin ETF operators, obtaining spot Bitcoin from within the regulated CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange). DeFi refers to decentralized finance, a catch-all term that includes cryptocurrencies and related protocols. The spot Hashdex Bitcoin ETF will trade on NYSE Arca and feature the second-largest fee at 0.94%, behind GBTC, the other converted ETF. Jane Street, Macquarie, and Virtu Americas are authorized participants. What about Bitcoin futures? Spot Bitcoin ETFs are newly approved in the United States, but the SEC approved Bitcoin futures ETFs back in 2021 and those have been trading since. Bitcoin futures ETFs let investors speculate on the future price of the asset, rather than investing into a fund that actually holds the asset and ebbs and flows based on its price. Current Bitcoin futures ETFs in the United States include the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) and the Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF (BITQ), both listed on NYSE Arca.
